/**
 * MBP1 `clientInstallationId` (bridge-pairing-protocol.md §6.4, §6.7).
 *
 * A random opaque tag for this extension *install*. It is a member of
 * `Principal` (§6.7), a field of `pairHello` (§6.1), and one of the four
 * strings bound into `A_id` — so it is inside the SPAKE2 transcript (§6.4).
 * Its only job is to separate multiple installs or browser profiles of the
 * same extension, which is what makes the post-authentication
 * `prunePrincipalExcept` sound: a second profile is a *different* principal
 * and pairs as its own credential instead of pruning the first profile's.
 *
 * It is client-chosen and unauthenticated. The server binds it into the
 * transcript but never trusts it, so nothing here is a security decision.
 *
 * **Never derived from anything fingerprintable.** `crypto.randomUUID()` only —
 * no hardware, locale, timezone, screen, user-agent or installation-time
 * input. A derived value would turn a routing tag into a cross-site
 * identifier, and it would also break the multi-profile story, since two
 * profiles on one machine would derive the same tag and merge into one
 * principal.
 *
 * ## Why first-write-wins has to be enforced by re-reading
 *
 * The naive shape — `get()`, and if absent generate and `set()` — races, and
 * MV3 service workers really do get concurrent invocations. If two flows each
 * generate a different id, one wins the write while the other may already have
 * sent *its* id in `pairHello`. The transcript then binds an id that is not
 * the persisted one, the next reconnect computes a different `principalKey`,
 * and the credential just created is orphaned and permanently unreachable —
 * the user's pairing silently stops working and no retry fixes it, because the
 * stored credential can never be looked up again.
 *
 * So the whole `read → generate-if-absent → write` sequence runs inside one
 * serialized critical section, with the read *inside* it. The queue is
 * module-level rather than per-instance on purpose: a per-instance queue only
 * serializes callers that happen to share an object, and the two racing flows
 * here are independent call sites, not a shared store handle. There is
 * deliberately no class to construct, so there is no way to accidentally
 * create a second queue.
 *
 * After a first write the value is re-read and the *persisted* value returned.
 * `storage.local` offers no compare-and-swap, so a second JS realm (an options
 * page driving pairing directly, rather than messaging the service worker)
 * could still clobber the write; re-reading narrows that residual window to
 * the write itself and guarantees the returned id equals what storage held
 * when the critical section ended, instead of returning a value that was
 * already overwritten.
 *
 * The id is never cleared — not on unpair, not on "Forget". It identifies the
 * install, not the pairing, and regenerating it would make every stored
 * credential of the old principal unreachable, which is the same failure the
 * serialization above exists to prevent.
