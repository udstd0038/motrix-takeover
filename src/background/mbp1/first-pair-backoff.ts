/**
 * MBP1 client-side global first-pair backoff (bridge-pairing-protocol.md §7.3).
 *
 * The client analogue of the server's `PairFloodControl` lockout, and the
 * client's half of the defense against online code guessing: the 40-bit code
 * space only holds up because a guesser is limited to ~3 attempts per session
 * *and* the sessions themselves are rate-limited.
 *
 * ```
 * lockout before failure n = min(30 · 2^(n-1), 3600) seconds, from that failure
 * ```
 *
 * ## One counter, keyed by nothing
 *
 * §7.3 requires "a **single truly global** first-pair failure counter — one
 * counter for all unauthenticated first-pair targets, deliberately **not**
 * keyed by `instanceId`, `port`, or any other attacker-controllable value".
 * There is therefore no key parameter anywhere in this API, by construction
 * rather than by convention.
 *
 * Review round 3 found the bug this exists to prevent: a counter keyed by
 * `instanceId` handed a fake listener a fresh counter every session, since the
 * listener simply returns a new `instanceId` each time. `instanceId` is a
 * routing hint and never a security signal (§4.1), so keying on it is keying on
 * the attacker's own input.
 *
 * The known cost — any local process can drive *everyone's* first-pair backoff
 * up by failing pairings — is an **accepted** residual in §1.1. Do not "fix" it
 * by narrowing the key; that reintroduces the round-3 bypass.
 *
 * ## Two reset arms, both required
 *
 * §7.3: the counter "resets on a successful pairing **or after 24 h**". The
 * second arm is not cosmetic. Without it the exponent never decays, so a user
 * who mistypes a code a handful of times spread over months accumulates an
 * unbounded exponent and eventually sits permanently at the 3600 s ceiling —
 * while the server, which does implement the 24 h reset, would impose only
 * 30 s. The client would lock itself out for an hour where the server invites
 * an immediate retry. Line A's `flood-control.ts` uses the same 24 h window, so
 * the two sides agree about when backoff has cleared.
 *
 * This module logs nothing at any level (§11): the only inputs are a failure
 * count and a timestamp, and both are security-sensitive here.
