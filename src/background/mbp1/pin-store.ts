/**
 * MBP1 client pin store (bridge-pairing-protocol.md §12, §4.1).
 *
 * A pin records where a given credential last authenticated: `{port,
 * instanceId}`, keyed by `credentialId`. Its only purpose is to skip the
 * candidate-port sweep on the next reconnect.
 *
 * **A pin is a routing hint and never a trust decision** (§4.1). Neither
 * `port` nor `instanceId` is authenticated by anything — `/discovery` is
 * unauthenticated and replayable, and any local process can serve a matching
 * `instanceId`. So nothing in this module, and nothing that reads it, may
 * decide anything on the strength of a pin beyond *which endpoint to try
 * first*. A matching pin is a fast path; the reconnect challenge–response
 * (§8) is what actually authenticates. A stale, wrong, or forged pin can
 * therefore only cost a failed attempt and a sweep.
 *
 * That is also why nothing here is encrypted or hardened: there is no secret
 * in a pin. `browser.storage.local` is sandboxed to the extension and
 * protected by OS user isolation, as for other extension settings.
 *
 * Boundedness is a caller obligation, not a policy this store enforces: §12
 * requires the post-authentication prune to delete "all other stored
 * credentials **and pins** for that same principal", and
 * `CredentialStore.prunePrincipalExcept` returns exactly the ids to pass to
 * `clear`. No eviction policy is implemented here because a cap can never be
 * needed for safety — it is the caller's loop that keeps the map the size of
 * the live credential set.
