 * ```
 *
 * ## Three things that are easy to get subtly, dangerously wrong
 *
 * **1. `pairAccept` carries no approval semantics.** It means "the server
 * queued the dialog" and nothing more — the user may still be reading it, or
 * may dismiss it. Only a `confirmB` that verifies proves the user approved. So
 * nothing is persisted, nothing is reported as success, and no state this flow
 * returns can read "paired" until that verification passes. Line A's own frame
 * comment says the same thing from the other side.
 *
 * **2. `attemptsRemaining` is untrusted display data.** §6.5 requires the
 * extension to enforce *its own* ceiling of 3 runs per session and its own
 * 180 s session deadline "regardless of what the peer reports". A fake or
 * relaying listener will happily answer `codeMismatch` with
 * `attemptsRemaining: 99` forever, harvesting one password test per induced
 * run; the local ceiling is the only thing that stops it. The value is
 * forwarded to the code provider for display and is never read by any
 * control-flow decision.
 *
 * **3. The write-ahead ordering is not a nicety.** §6.7 step 2: the durable
 * `unacked → commit-uncertain` flip MUST land **before** `credentialAck` is
 * transmitted, so that `commit-uncertain` can mean "the ack *may* have been
 * sent". A crash in that gap then lands in the retain-forever state instead of
 * the age-out state, which is the difference between a client that can recover
 * and one that is stranded on a credential the server already committed.
 *
 * ## Failure accounting (§7.2, §7.3)
 *
 * A §7.3 failure is any session that **reached `pakeA`** and ended without
 * mutual confirmation, *for any reason* — bad `cA`, identity `K`, a malformed
 * frame, a protocol abort, the socket closing mid-run, or this flow abandoning
 * the attempt itself. §7.3 names the self-abandoned case explicitly so a
 * guesser cannot dodge the counter by hanging up before exhausting a code, so
 * the accounting lives in `run`'s exit path rather than at any individual
 * failure site.
 *
 * A session that never reached `pakeA` — refused by the local gate, a bad
 * nonce, `busy`, a malformed `pairAccept` — records nothing. That is the
 * documented asymmetry with the server, which increments as soon as a
 * code-bearing dialog is queued (§7.3: "the two count at slightly different
 * points").
 *
 * ## Logging
 *
 * Nothing here logs at any level (§11). The pairing code, `w`, `x`, `K`,
 * `Ke`/`Ka`, `KcA`/`KcB`, the confirmation MACs, the §6.6 traffic keys,
 * `mutualKey`, `bindingPriv` and the ticket are all in scope in this module,
 * and §11 additionally forbids logging `pairError` codes. The thrown messages
 * below name a step, never a value.
