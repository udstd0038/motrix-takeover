/**
 * MBP1 discovery strategy chain (bridge-pairing-protocol.md §4.1, §4.2, §12).
 *
 * Answers one question: *which loopback endpoint should the next MBP1 handshake
 * be attempted against?* Nothing more. Every value this module returns is a
 * **routing hint and never a trust decision** (§4.1) — `/discovery` is
 * unauthenticated and replayable, and any local process can serve a matching
 * `instanceId`. So a pinned-port hit is a *fast path*, not an
 * authentication; the §6 PAKE or the §8 challenge–response is what actually
 * authenticates, and a wrong hint costs one failed attempt and a sweep.
 *
 * ## The two routes are not interchangeable
 *
 * | Route | Method | Header | Semantics |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | `GET /discovery` (§4.1) | GET | none | unauthenticated, replayable liveness hint |
 * | `POST /nonce` (§4.2) | POST | `X-Motrix-Bridge: 1` | one-shot, capped, rate-limited |
 *
 * **Liveness polling uses `/discovery`, never `/nonce`.** Line B shipped
 * exactly the opposite: it used the nonce route as its liveness probe inside a
 * launch-poll loop and burned roughly seventy-five nonces per bootstrap
 * against a server that caps outstanding nonces at 32 and rate-limits
 * issuance. The trap is that `X-Motrix-Bridge: 1` and the `POST` method feel
 * like they belong to "bridge requests" generally; they belong to the nonce
 * fetch alone. This module keeps them in exactly one place — `fetchNonce` —
 * and `ensureNonce` is the only public path that reaches it, once, for the
 * candidate that was actually selected.
 *
 * ## This module never writes to `PinStore`
 *
 * It takes a read-only `PinReader` on purpose. §12 puts both pin writes
 * elsewhere: `commit` happens only after a mutually-authenticated session, and
 * the §8 "not my Motrix" `clear` happens in the reconnect flow that saw the
 * bad accept MAC. Discovery cannot tell "Motrix is not running" from "Motrix
 * moved ports", so clearing a pin on a failed probe would discard a still-
 * correct hint every time the user simply quits the app.
 *
 * Nonces MUST NOT be persisted by any party (§4.2) — they are returned to the
 * caller and never touch `storage.local` here.
